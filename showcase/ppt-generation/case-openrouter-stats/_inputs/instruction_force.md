Before you begin, read the two input files:

1. **Read `/app/benchmark/source_brief.md`** — this is your **sole content source**. It contains all the subject-matter text, data tables, statistics, and figure references you may use in the presentation. Do not fabricate any data beyond what this file provides.
2. **Read `/app/benchmark/task_input.json`** — this defines the **structural requirements**: deck metadata (slide count, aspect ratio, audience, tone) and a per-slide outline (id, title, objective) that your presentation must follow.

Create a 16:9, 7-slide data analysis report PPT in English, targeted at LLM industry professionals (R&D, product, investment).

This deck should be data-driven, clearly presenting the current LLM market usage landscape, competitive dynamics, and emerging trends.

Use the 7 slide titles provided in the `slides` array of `task_input.json` exactly as given, in order, as the title for each slide.
Slide 2 (Top 10 Models) must use a table or chart to present the ranking data.
Slide 3 (Provider Market Share) must use a pie chart or bar chart to show the share distribution.
Do not fabricate any data or statistics not found in source_brief.md.

Save the final PPT to `/app/output/final_deck.pptx`.

Only the correctly saved final file is needed — no additional explanation is required.

## Automated Execution Rules

There is no human operator online for this session. Follow these rules:

1. **Follow the provided /app/skills skills first** — use the skills available under `/app/skills` as the primary guidance and workflow for completing the project.
2. **Skip all confirmation/approval/user-input steps** — do not pause, ask questions, or wait for a reply. When encountering BLOCKING or "wait for user confirmation" instructions, make a professional judgment and proceed.
3. **Design decisions** — if `task_input.json` specifies fields such as `deck.tone` or `deck.audience`, use them to guide template, color palette, and style choices; otherwise, use your professional judgment.
4. **Do not deploy or share** — no deployment, PDF export, share links, or other post-delivery steps are needed.
5. **Priority** — these rules take precedence over any interactive-wait instructions in SKILL.md. The workflow, quality standards, and technical specifications in SKILL.md remain in effect; only interactive waits are skipped.
